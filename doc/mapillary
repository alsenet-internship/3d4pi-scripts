For the scripts to work they need to be placed in the python folder of https://github.com/mapillary/mapillary_tools

The Script dependencies:

‣By Mapillary scripts:
•python2
•python-exifread
•gpxpy
•PIL
•pyexiv2

‣By my bash scripts:
•exiftool(perl-image-exiftool)
•ImageMagick
•(have to be placed in the python directory of Mapillard_tools)

AddSphereXMP.sh creates XMP tags from present exif tags needed by mapillary for panoramas
copygpstime.sh copies gps time data to exif original time data needed bd mapillary script
upload.sh reduces size adds needed metadata with the other scripts and uplaods to mapillary

Detailed Explenation:
Mappillary requires username, email and password or username, hash and securityhash to be set   
as envirement variable for uploads depending on the tool used

Some mapillary tools works only on .jpg (not on .jpeg)

Mapillary needs its own sets of tags writen into the description tag of the image:

`{"MAPSequenceUUID": "a57da8e1-0c9b-4b40-8969-1cad5fce8e4a", "MAPSettingsEmail": "email@domain.cdn", "MAPOrientation": 1, "MAPPhotoUUID": "a1b5b598-a762-447c-8ecd-565eef758da9", "MAPDeviceMake": "none", "MAPDeviceModel": "none", "MAPLongitude": 7.040963333333333, "MAPSettingsUsername": "username", "MAPCaptureTime": "2016_05_04_13_11_11_600", "MAPLatitude": 46.88145333333333, "MAPSettingsUploadHash": "someuploadhash", "MAPCompassHeading": {"TrueHeading": 61.89999999999998, "MagneticHeading": 61.89999999999998}}` 

to create this Tag Mapillary puts the script add_mappillary_tag_from_exif.py at disposition.

For it to work it needs:
•the Gps data in the exif metadata, 
•orientation metadata in exif (use interpolate_direction.py  to interpolate from gps from mapillary), 
•date and time in the DateTimeOriginal and SubSecTimeOriginal tag Reading it from GPS data is not implemented yet,
 So I wrote the script copygpstime.sh to create those tags from the gps metadata.

For Panoramas Mapillary als needs photo sphere XMP Metadata, the script AddSphereXMP.sh adds the minimum 
required fields defined by google and confirmed no further tag is needed from Mapillary.

Wrote upload.sh script this will create all data needed and upload images, might overright some data if new 
image sets will get some of this data before hand.
